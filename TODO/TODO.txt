One callback function for all ble features or Four callbacks functions each for other BLE role: Broadcaster, Observer, Server, Client.
Each BLE role can provide app by different wireless functionality.
Typedef Struct for: ROLE choice (in case of one callback), FEATURE chice.
ROLE choice:
	-Observer
	-Broadcaster
	-Server
	-Client
	
FEATURE choice:
	-Advertising :
		*Broadcast
		*Streaming
	-Scaning
	-Notify
	-Notify with response
	-Write

Data interchange :
	Globals data struct, when multitasking - data must be bloced for calculate time
	
Data block options:
	-Blocking		- If you want to block the specific data when one task is calculating
	-None blocking	- Non blocking option
	-Scharing		- If you don't want to block the data by one task you can use doubled data matrix - first place for calculating data, second place for old data
	-Block Scharing - Like in sharing options but both of position are bloced as long as both are different
	
	struct:
		+bool block
		
		+uint8_t data			<- in case of using blocking/noneblocking method
		+uint16_t schare_data 	<- in case of using scharing mathod
		
		+bool (*block_data)()
		+bool (*schare_data)()
